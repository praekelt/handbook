Our commercial divisions work with clients who share our passion and who want to reach their emerging market consumers through innovative, scalable mobile solutions.  We don’t just take on any work, and in fact we’ve been known to fire clients when we feel they’re not moving in the same direction as we are. We look for clients that see us as partners, appreciate and take note of our expertise and generally give us the space to do great work.

Current .Com clients include:
- Telkom
- DSTV
- Nampak
- Diageo 
- Nike

Praekelt Foundation was started in 2007 to make use of the technology created by the Commercial division in order to have a social impact. Until 2011, The Foundation was fully funded by the Commercial division, with project funding coming from donor grants. In 2010, we were awarded a 3 year funding grant from the Omidyar Network in order to expand our team base and we’ve been able to increase our impact dramatically since this time.

The Praekelt Foundation is described as “a technology incubator that develops mobile technology solutions for social good.” We believe mobile is the only way to bring life-saving information and services to people in Africa and other emerging markets. The Foundation primarily works in Southern and Eastern Africa at the moment, but we’re exploring opportunities within West Africa and India. We typically work in close partnership with NGOs and governments to help them better reach their target markets through the use of mobile technology.
