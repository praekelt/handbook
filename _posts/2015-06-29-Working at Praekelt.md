## Working at Praekelt

Praekelt is not the usual 9-5 “don’t sit there, that’s my desk” kind of environment. If that’s what you’re after, we’ve failed miserably at our recruiting process. Our offices are free seating and hopefully fun to hang out in - but there’s no expectation for you to work from there all day everyday. We’d like to see you at least 2-3 days per week (one of which should be a Monday) because that face-to-face interaction is really important, and in your first few weeks, we suggest you’re in the office most days while you get a handle on things. After that, we leave you to work in the way you find most productive. We hire people who can work independently and so we trust you to deliver the hours expected. 

The Praekelt team works remotely but we like to use the office for getting together and sharing. You’ll find Slack, Skype and Hangouts to be very effective internal communication tools - see [Praekelt Tools](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S-vZ9JzMjjBsj0fdNcE5RhjFJQXGnDd5XJnX1dBybl0/edit#) for more information on all the tools we use on a daily basis.

We’ve also developed our own dictionary of tech terms that you’re likely to encounter while working at Praekelt - this is our [Cryptonomicon](https://docs.google.com/a/praekeltconsulting.com/document/d/1Nkfk4wpYds6aFmQk3XWhnCtgQoNiUsyJzzD1U0MnPlk/edit). It’s designed as a reference tool - if you feel there’s something missing, please add to it, but we hope you’ll find it useful as you start out with us. If you’re coming from a less technical background and you’d like to improve your tech skills, you’ll find Code-Dojo groups running in both the Joburg and Cape Town offices, where our amazing Developers share some of their knowledge with those of us less technically minded. We’ve also collected a list of articles / videos that might be of interest to you [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NSXV7T4ZxrZru9AjfX1YFbyPL1ohUfydD70bgFmnBVU/edit).

We’re not a very formal company but we do have a few [Company Policies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VIkAZJGSnuaJ3lEKd6DgskH7x3-R35xmawHKb03noN4/edit#heading=h.exxmv9wl1vlo) which you should read through when you have a chance. We’ll let you know when new policies are added so you have the chance to read through these.

We have our own invoicing and costing system set up called Xnet. You’ll receive training on this but it will take some time to feel comfortable with the system. Until then, please ask Jane or one of the Programme Managers (who work most with Xnet) for assistance if you get stuck. 

**### Project Management Processes**
Through much trial and error, we’ve come up with a number of templates which are designed to make sure that you save time and avoid errors by covering all the bases upfront. This is typically how we would see a project rolling out:

**1. Business Development** - the initial sales lead is generated and the initial brief taken, with an innovative solution being proposed. Discussions continue until the client is happy with the concept and the estimated budget.

**2. Budgeting / Costing and Scope of Work** - once an initial approval is received from the client, a Scope of Work will need to be prepared to make sure all elements of the project are covered in detail. This ensures that the client is 100% sure of what they are (and aren’t) buying, costings are accurate, and the team can budget timelines based on an accurate reflection of the project scope.  A detailed costing is then prepared on Xnet and presented to the client for a Purchase Order (PO). Work cannot proceed until a PO has been received and the initial portion of the project has been invoiced for. Full details of the Budgeting / Costing process are available here.

**3. Project Management** - Once signed off, the Project Management team will set up an [Asana](www.asana.com) Project which is used to house all information relating to the project, as well as track tasks and requirements for the broader team. The PM is responsible for keeping this up to date. The [Project Master Document](https://docs.google.com/a/praekeltconsulting.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuFU_wce9xhpdFI4M0FQT09VQlJwVlRRcWJ0eXlMSVE#gid=17) is useful in reminding you of all the steps that need to be covered off for the roll out of the project. The Programme Manager or Client Lead will continue to keep the client updated throughout the process, while the Programme Manager will liaise with the developers (internal / external), the creative and strategy teams and ensure that the project is tracked according to the client’s expectations.

**4. Testing / Launch / Review** - Once the development process has been completed, testing will need to be completed before launch. We have a Control Centre set-up to handle testing and QA - the Programme Manager will compile a brief for this testing. Once launched, the project should be monitored, preferably via a dashboard, to ensure that it is delivering on client expectations.
[Here’s](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDQd44m0IeAsCTLtL_O3PlMRSP18DHDlAArWszl5qlE/edit#heading=h.goue6qmrqggr) some background on the SRE team structure and ways of working.

**Scheduling Work In**
Each team has their own process for scheduling in work, and generally their own preferred briefing tools.

Strat Team / Creative Team
Briefs should be submitted to strat@praekelt.com / design@praekelt.com and Lebo Semetsamere will either come back to you to request additional information, or will schedule the work in and confirm when you can expect delivery.

Engineering
Attend the sprint planning meeting at the beginning of a sprint to ensure that your work is included in the sprint. 

Control Centre Team
Briefs for QA and Testing should be submitted to controlroom@praekelt.com and Nelson will come back to you to confirm when this work has been scheduled, and when it is expected to be completed.

### What to do when things go wrong
Inevitably, things go wrong and it’s important not to panic (too much).  Your first point of call should be your Team Lead, who will often be able to assist you or will be able to advise who you should ask for help. Praekelt people are always busy so there is a tendency to not want to disturb them, but if you reach out for help, you are sure to get it. The most important thing is to speak up - don’t keep quiet about a problem.

### Ask for Forgiveness - not Permission
This is Gustav’s motto and it’s something we live by at Praekelt. There are of course limits to this, but the general principle is that if you believe you have found the best possible solution to a problem, don’t make the problem worse by waiting for approvals. Rather go ahead and do your best to solve the problem. As long as you have thought through this fully and as long as you are acting in the company’s best interests, you will have the team’s support. But again, there’s no need to suffer in silence - if you’re not totally comfortable with your decision, ask for a 2nd opinion, either from your Team Lead or from Gustav himself.
