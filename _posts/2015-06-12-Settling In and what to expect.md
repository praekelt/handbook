## Settling in - what to expect

Hopefully our recruitment process has helped you to feel that you know us as well as we know you. In order to help you settle in as quickly as possible, you’ll now go through an induction and later, an onboarding process. Here’s how it should work:

### Induction

Your first few days with us will be all about absorbing as much information as possible. We’re continually documenting our processes so you should have lots of reading material to get through. Here’s what you should expect in your first few days:

- Meeting with your Line Manager to talk through what will be expected of you
- Meeting with all company Team Leads to find out what they do and how their teams work
- Meeting with all members of your team to find out what they do and how they expect to interact with you

During this time, we’d prefer that you don’t get into work mode - we’ve found from experience that if we don’t give you enough time to settle in, it will take a lot longer for you to find your feet.

### Starter Pack Sessions (Onboarding)
Once you’ve been with us for 6-8 weeks, you’ll probably be finding your feet, but wishing you could remember some of the info that was shared with you in the Induction, which has since disappeared due to “information overload.” If you’re based outside of South Africa, you may also be finding it hard to relate to people that you haven’t yet met.

So we’ll arrange for you to spend a week with us in our Joburg or Cape Town office. This is what you can expect during this time:

- Half day meeting with Gustav Praekelt to hear his vision for the company and to spend time chatting about your role in the company as we move forward
- Full day with your Team, making sure that you’re on top of all the necessary processes and making sure any questions which have cropped up have been answered
- Final day with other Team Leads, who’ll answer any questions you may have about how their teams operate, and fill in any gaps that you’ve found since the Induction session


### Probation
As you’ll have noticed from your employment contract, you’ll be in an initial probation period for the first six months of your employment with Praekelt. This is nothing to worry about - it just means that we pay extra attention to you during this time to make sure that you’re coping and finding your feet. You should expect to have regular meetings with your Team Lead to chat about how you’re settling in and to give you the opportunity to raise any concerns that you have. We’ll do a 1 month, 3 month and 5 month check-in with you to see how you’re doing, and give you any additional training or support needed.

At the end of the probation period, you should already know exactly how you’ve been doing through the regular meetings you’ve been having. But there will be a formal probation review session to mark the end of this period. Your Team Lead will report on how you’ve done, you’ll be asked to give us feedback, and a handful of your colleagues will be asked to rate how well you’ve fitted into Praekelt. Assuming this all goes well, and we’re sure it will, you’ll become a permanent staff member.

This process may seem very formal, but we’ve found that if we can’t get someone settled well in the first six months, it’s unlikely that things will work out well in the long term. You may still feel that you’re not on top of things after 6 months - totally normal, with the industry we’re in, you’ll probably always feel like this - but we do want to be sure that you fit into the Praekelt way of working.

We do want to stress that you shouldn’t panic in silence - if you feel that balls are dropping and you don’t have a clue what to do, let us know about it. Get in touch with your Team Lead or with Helen or with someone you feel comfortable with in your team, but make sure you reach out so that we can support you. If we don’t know that you’re struggling, we can’t help. 

### Annual Reviews
Although you should be receiving regular feedback from your Team Lead throughout the years, we find that having a more formal annual review is a great way of making sure you’re getting the feedback and support you’d like, as well as checking in to see how you’re doing. These reviews take place in January / February (the end of our fiscal) and are designed to be very interactive. You’ll be asked to prepare a self assessment for this, your manager will assess you and we’ll also share peer review feedback with you - but mostly this is used to start a conversation about how you’re doing and what you’d like to achieve in the year ahead. Full details of the Annual Review process are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1doRGny6K5f8pjv68rt5QMYT3NnXwa2h_k_6N4RTgRPE/edit#heading=h.8zes2imnrh99). 

### Buddy System
We've recently reintroduced a "buddy" mentoring system at Praekelt, which will partner a new team member with someone at Praekelt (outside of their team) who would be someone they could count on to help them settle into Praekelt life. The Buddy System will continue to help people settle into the company after the Induction week is completed and will hopefully avoid people feeling that they've been left to "sink or swim".
Specific areas that you could ask your “Buddy” to help you with:
Making sure you understand our values, mission and vision
Being your “champion” in the business
Providing introductions, and a bridge to other people in the company
Taking a long-term interest in your career development 
Meeting up with them, in person, on a regular basis
If you'd like to volunteer to be a "Buddy" yourself in the future, please let Helen know.
