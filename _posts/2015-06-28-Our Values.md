## Our Values

### Performance
As part of a growing company in a fast-moving industry, you’ll find that you work hard at Praekelt. We hope that you’ll enjoy what you’re doing and find it rewarding, making the hard work seem interesting and inspiring, but you are likely to find yourself putting in long hours leading up to deadlines. However, we do believe that finding a work:life balance is really important and we’ll do what we can to make sure that you take time off to rest up during the year. You’ll have noticed a clause in your contract that stipulates that you can’t hold leave over from one fiscal to the next - we have this because we believe that taking time off every year is really important and we don’t want a situation where you save up days of leave and end up exhausted.

### Autonomy & Respect
Praekelt is not a timesheet company, you won’t be asked to clock in or clock out and although we keep track of leave taken, for the most part you’re left alone to get on with your job in the most effective way possible. We do have “Office Mondays” to make sure that you’ll see the rest of the team at least one day per week so please do your best to work from your local office on Monday, as well as any other days that your team may have set up (eg. Wednesdays for the Dev Team). The most important thing for us is that you deliver what needs delivering.
 
This said, we do ask that you respect the processes which the company has worked hard to put in place, as these have come from trial and error and ultimately are ways of working which we’ve found to be most effective. If you can improve on them, give us your ideas and let’s discuss them. Respect for your colleagues is equally important – they work as hard as you to deliver their element of the chain and if you don’t keep up your end of the work, you place unnecessary pressure on the rest of the team, which ultimately leads to an unhappy work environment. And finally, we ask that you respect our clients and partners, who chose to work with us – no matter how frustrated you might be feeling, lashing out at a client or partner is only going to exacerbate the situation. And losing your temper with them is likely to cause them to lose respect for you and possibly even the company. So Respect is a big value for us.

### Teamwork and Collaboration
We’re a growing company but we retain a start-up feel, which makes sure that we’re agile and can move quickly as mobile trends change. In order to do this, it’s important that we have a team of people who can work to support each other and who have a great understanding of what we do, across the company. Collaboration is core to our way of working – from the way decisions are taken right down to the way we write up documents, with everyone having the chance to give input through Google Docs.  We value opinions so want you to speak out if you disagree or feel that you have something to add, even if it contradicts other opinions. That’s how we’ll grow as a team and avoid falling into “groupthink” mode. 

### Fun
At Praekelt, we like to have fun – it’s a great way to alleviate stress. You’ll find plenty of good-natured joking and teasing going on in Slack, which hopefully you’ll feel comfortable to join in on, once you’re settled into the team. We also get the full team together once a year to talk about the year we’ve just completed, the year we have ahead of us and generally to make sure that we’re all on the same page moving forward. Aside from this, we’re always looking for an opportunity to have impromptu drinks session - and if you’re working in the Joburg and Cape Town offices, come to work hungry on Mondays as the team gets together for lunch. We want you to enjoy coming to work and to have fun with what you’re doing – we think this is the way to success for Praekelt.

### Innovation & Creativity
Innovation is at the heart of what we do and whilst we appreciate that not everyone is artistic, we do believe that there are opportunities to bring innovation and creativity into everything we do. From time to time we’ll try and push you in this direction, encouraging you to think “out of the box” to come up with a Bounty idea (for which we give cool rewards). Slack is another place to air any ideas which you might have or stories which you think might interest your colleagues.

### Transparency
Praekelt Foundation is run in a very transparent way with input being encouraged and sought out from the entire team. Our F16 strategy session was run as a Google Hangout to enable all Foundation team members to contribute or just listen in and we do our best to ensure that decisions are kept as open as possible.
