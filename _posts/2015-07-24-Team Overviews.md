All the time. Business Development never ends. Even at the most busy times, when you think that you have plenty of work in the system, the Business Development cycle needs to continue working, to ensure that we have work in 6 or 12 months

**Where? **

We get email leads via our website or contacted via Twitter. Individual team members may receive a direct mail. We meet people at conferences, and we are introduces to projects through existing relationships and projects. We find out about RFPs and RFQs that are published

We are on [Google Docs](https://drive.google.com/drive/#folders/0Bx2KUKL7NSVuVGJUdVd4MkVDN1U) 

**How? **
Project Evaluations (whether we take something on or not), are done based on the following criteria: 
- Scale 
- Impact
- Mobile first
- Relationship 
- Innovation
- Capacity 
- Skillset

Once we have decided as a team that we are going to pursue a new opportunity we work with a micro-team to develop the proposal / RFP requirements.
