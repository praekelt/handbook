**Where? **

We get email leads via our website or contacted via Twitter. Individual team members may receive a direct mail. We meet people at conferences, and we are introduces to projects through existing relationships and projects. We find out about RFPs and RFQs that are published

**How? **

Project Evaluations (whether we take something on or not), are done based on the following criteria: 
- Scale 
- Impact

Once we have decided as a team that we are going to pursue a new opportunity we work with a micro-team to develop the proposal / RFP requirements.

Strategy is heavily involved in the Business Development cycle, as they will compile the strategic documentation that will assist with us winning the business. 

When a project is won, they are responsible for ensuring that the team in on board and understands the strategic direction, as well as writing up the Scope of Work that will be signed off by all relevant parties. They will be involved throughout the project lifecycle, for ongoing assessment of the programme, insights on how to improve it, and instructions on how reporting of the programme should be handled. 

Throughout the live stage of the projects, strategists will be required to collaborate with the M&E functions of any project, and make recommendations

**Where? **

Their time is booked by Lisa on a schedule. A PO is required in order to confirm the booking.

They are also often flitting around the world, visiting the areas that our platforms are being used the most. 

**How? **

By understanding the target audience, the problem that we are trying to solve, and the technology that will allow us to create impact

Because someone has to be able to simplify, and verbalise our roadmap in terms of impact that we will have, the technology that we will use, and the content that we will deliver.
