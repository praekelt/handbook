**When? **

All the time. Business Development never ends. Even at the most busy times, when you think that you have plenty of work in the system, the Business Development cycle needs to continue working, to ensure that we have work in 6 or 12 months

**Where? **

We get email leads via our website or contacted via Twitter. Individual team members may receive a direct mail. We meet people at conferences, and we are introduces to projects through existing relationships and projects. We find out about RFPs and RFQs that are published 
We are on Slack: https://praekelt.slack.com/messages/bizdev-org/files/F03755SKB/
We are on Asana :https://app.asana.com/0/34366586463709/36276538213674
We are on Google Docs (“BizDev” folder = our RFP Folder with standard RFP documentation, etc) https://drive.google.com/drive/#folders/0Bx2KUKL7NSVuVGJUdVd4MkVDN1U 

**How? **
Project Evaluations (Whether we take something on or not), are done based on the following criteria: 
- Scale 
- Impact
- Mobile first
- Relationship 
- Innovation
- Capacity 
- Skillset
Once we have decided as a team that we are indeed going to pursue a new opportunity we work with a micro-team to develop the proposal / RFP requirements.
