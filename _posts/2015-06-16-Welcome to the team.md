## Welcome to the Praekelt Foundation

We hope this will be the start of a long and happy career with us.  Praekelt is a unique place to work, and if you’re reading this, you can be sure we think you’re a pretty special person who’ll fit right in. It can be a little overwhelming when you first start out so we’ve put together a Handbook to help you find your way.  

This is a working document so please give us feedback on what you think we’ve missed or what we could improve to help people joining in the future. 

With that said, let’s introduce ourselves properly...
