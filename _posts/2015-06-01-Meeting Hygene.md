## Our meeting hygene tips

Few people enjoy meetings, we at Praekelt are the same.

Ever finished the work day and said: "Gosh, I wish today I had more meetings"? Us neither.

Here are a couple of tips we use to make them less painful for everyone.

### Guard everyone's time

Time is a very precious resource.

We can't get it back and we'd all like more.

An attendee of your meeting has agreed to give you some of their precious time so use it wisely and respectfully.

### Start and end on time

This seems obvious, but watch this.

For "virtual meetings", start a group chat with everyone on the call a few minutes before.

A general rule is 7 minutes late to start, 5 minutes late to finish, no more.

If you are going to be a few minutes late for a meeting, tell the meeting organiser. It's polite.

### Running out of time

This happens a lot.

When you run out of time, agree on the next followup meeting and adjourn.

Prepare better for the follow up meeting and try again.

### 'Decision-makers' have to attend

Decisions need to be made and there are decision makers to make them.

If the key decision makers are not in the meeting, don't waste everyone else's time.

Adjourn and reschedule.

### Use people's non-attendance as leverage

This sounds sinister, it's not meant to be.

If people didn't attend, it gives you a fact to further your cause.

"Hi DecisionMaker, we need your help with X. This is the third time we have tried to meet to discuss and we really need you to help us make a call on this, otherwise we are going to run out of time."

Possible responses could be:

- "It's not my call" (So who's call is it ?)
- "I don't have enough information to make the call" (What information is missing?)
- "I don't want to make the call" (Why?)
- ...

Either way, we are progressing the discussion.

If you drive this, we believe, people will make the time and make decisions. 

Focus on getting decisions.

### If you achieved what you needed, stop

These are our favourite types of meetings that don't happen too often.

If you have achieved your goal for the meeting and have time to spare, adjourn early.

Give people some of their time back. 

### Take notes

Lots of them.

Can you remember what you had for dinner 3 nights ago? Neither can we.

In our experience, it is best to do this digitally as invariably you will have to email follow-ups and to do's.

You also don't want to have to "copy and paste" your hand-written notes into email.

### Meeting minutes

Send minutes of meeting to all as record of decisions made and action points.

Try and be as conscise as possible, there are lots of meetings.

We suggest not making the meeting minutes attachments in email as people are less likely to open them.

***No record of the meeting = the meeting didn't happen***

### Purpose and goal

At the start of the meeting state the purpose of the meeting and the desired output – Design or Process, etc.

Set the meeting in progress and start "goal or decision hunting".

### Goal or decision hunting

Once the meeting has started, actively be on the look out for decisions and answers.

If this is not the first time a topic is being discussed, watch and listen carefully because the answers are most likely in the discussion somewhere.

Decision made? Confirm and move on to the next item.

Goal achieved? Confirm and move on to the next item.

The ultimate goal is to not waste people's time.

### Keep focus

Don’t get distracted by a small issue that will take 20 minutes discussion, but not have an impact on the output desired from the meeting. 

Park issues for a follow up meeting.

### Stay positive and goal driven

Keep the discussion positive and goal driven.

### Luck favours the prepared

Know the environment you are trying to manage and behave accordingly.

### Pick up the phone / skype

Face-to-Face is better than email. People hide behind email.
