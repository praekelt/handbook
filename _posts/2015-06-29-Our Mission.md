## Our Mission

Praekelt Foundation uses open source technologies to deliver essential information and inclusive services to millions of people around the world, particularly in Africa. We work with governments, NGOs and social enterprises to create the information, inspiration and tools that allow people to change their own lives.

Praekelt Consulting was founded in 2003 by Gustav Praekelt, with Praekelt Foundation being founded in 2007. In the last few years, the company has grown rapidly from a small start-up to a company of 80 people working in over 17 countries with offices in 7 cities. We’ve kept the lean startup philosophy - we focus on providing innovative and scalable solutions for the majority world and to do this, we work fast, keeping ahead of changing technology as well as the changing needs of the end consumer. This pace can be a little daunting when first joining the team, but it’s also really exciting - you can be sure that things will never be boring at Praekelt!
