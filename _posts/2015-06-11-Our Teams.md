- PMs that are managing an existing project / client relationship. 
- Everyone else in the organisation can and should be doing business development

**What?**

- Manage new relationships
- Are involved in the project life cycle until sign-off/ approval - after which a project gets handed over to the production team.

- Are responsible for coordinating Proposal / RFP documentation  drafting
- Are responsible for Proposal / RFP submissions
- Attend meetings and conferences to spot opportunities

**When? **

All the time. Business Development never ends. Even at the most busy times, when you think that you have plenty of work in the system, the Business Development cycle needs to continue working, to ensure that we have work in 6 or 12 months

**Where? **

We get email leads via our website or contacted via Twitter. Individual team members may receive a direct mail. We meet people at conferences, and we are introduces to projects through existing relationships and projects. We find out about RFPs and RFQs that are published 

- We are on [Slack](https://praekelt.slack.com/messages/bizdev-org/): #bizdev-org
- We are on [Asana](https://app.asana.com/0/34366586463709/36276538213674)
- We are on [Google Docs](https://drive.google.com/drive/#folders/0Bx2KUKL7NSVuVGJUdVd4MkVDN1U) 

**How? **

Project Evaluations (whether we take something on or not), are done based on the following criteria: 
- Scale 
- Impact
- Mobile first
- Relationship 
- Innovation
- Capacity 
- Skillset

Once we have decided as a team that we are going to pursue a new opportunity we work with a micro-team to develop the proposal / RFP requirements.

## Strategy

**Who? **
- Debbie Rogers
- Jonathan MacKay
- Pippa Yeats
- Maritza van den Heuvel
- Jacqui Watson

**What? **
- Attending meetings and conferences to spot opportunities
- Writing up Concept Notes and Scopes of Work that guide our projects
- Establishing (or working with a team to establish) the monitoring and evaluation criteria of each project
- Ensuring that our projects have an impact on the end user
- Determining technical solutions with the engineers to meet a project’s needs
- Interfacing with clients where and when required to present strategic deliverables

**When? **

Strategy is heavily involved in the Business Development cycle, as they will compile the strategic documentation that will assist with us winning the business. 

When a project is won, they are responsible for ensuring that the team in on board and understands the strategic direction, as well as writing up the Scope of Work that will be signed off by all relevant parties. They will be involved throughout the project lifecycle, for ongoing assessment of the programme, insights on how to improve it, and instructions on how reporting of the programme should be handled. 

Throughout the live stage of the projects, strategists will be required to collaborate with the M&E functions of any project, and make recommendations

**Where? **

Their time is booked by Lisa on a schedule. A PO is required in order to confirm the booking. 

Join our conversations on [Slack](https://praekelt.slack.com/messages/strat-org/): strat-org

They are also often flitting around the world, visiting the areas that our platforms are being used the most. 

**How? **

By understanding the target audience, the problem that we are trying to solve, and the technology that will allow us to create impact

**Why?**

Because someone has to be able to simplify, and verbalise our roadmap in terms of impact that we will have, the technology that we will use, and the content that we will deliver. 

## Content

Content is involved from the Business Development stage to ensure that we understand and can deliver the required content via the relevant channel. They are most active in the production and maintenance phase of a project, ensuring that content is kept up to date and relevant to the end user. 

**How?** 
We have years of experience in content delivery, moderation and creation. Tamsen and the team draw on this experience to guide the strategic decisions made about content on each channel.

We gather on [Slack](https://praekelt.slack.com/messages/org-pm/): org-pm

Each project in ‘production’ has the following: 
- Github repository
- Asana Project
- Slack Channel
- Jira Project
- Xnet project
- Group Email
- Google Drive Folder

Different tools are used at different stages of the development life-cycle 
The Asana project is the single point of truth for any project, and will have all the relevant links and docs that pertain to the project. 

**When?**

- When a project has moved out of Business Development and into production
- Until a project is either shut down, or handed over to another partner

**How? **
- By understanding the strategic and technical requirements of the project, and what we are trying to achieve
- Understanding the funder landscape and how to solve a range of issues
- Having a plan on how to deliver the many and varied things that we create
- By managing risks and responding to issues as quickly as possible 

**Why?** 

We need someone to have a roadmap on how to complete a project, and that can liaise between client and funder requirements, and the internal team’s capacity and requirements. 

## User Experience and Design
We use the Praekelt Consulting Studio as well as a bevvy of specialists. We will tell you more about them when they have a gap in their schedule. 

## UX and Front End

- In a [ticket](https://praekelt.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=51&projectKey=SYS&quickFilter=111). Always in a ticket. 

**When?** 
- SRE need to approve new scopes of work - send them to Colin.
- SRE need to consider QA test plans early in the project - send the Scope of Work to Jason Barr.
- SRE are involved in the technical bootstrapping of new projects, provisioning QA servers, setting up Jira projects and users, and various related tasks.
- Once code has been written, SRE are involved in the first deploy to QA, to set up sideloader.
- SRE handle QA testing once code is ready for QA
- When the launch is approaching, SRE will provision and deploy the production hosting.
- Once the site/service is live, SRE will monitor the site and escalate outages to providers or engineering
- SRE handle QA testing for ongoing post launch releases

**How? **

Keep calm and log a [Jira ticket](https://praekelt.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=51&projectKey=SYS&quickFilter=111)

If in doubt, ask in #SRE

**Why?**

Without SRE:
- Clients discover sites are down before us
- Every deployment is its own special snowflake, and can only be supported by the developer who deployed it
- Sites get slow or go down and engineers are not necessarily good at troubleshooting live sites
- External dev partners would get root access to all production sites they developed
- External dev partners would need to support the production hosting of the sites they build on a 24x7 basis
- Backups would not exist
- Deployments would take long, and frequently fail

## Traffic

- Lisa Adams
- Verena Schmutz (Consulting) 

**What? **

- Managing scheduling of work that is in the system, and making this visible

**When? **
Every day. Traffic will keep up with all deliverables by each team member every day

**How?** 
- Email the brief and the PO to Lisa
